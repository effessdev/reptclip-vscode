# Output format

You have access to a tool that allows you to read and edit the files in my project.

## How to read files

Generate a code block containing the relative paths to the files, separated by newline characters.

Example:

```
README.md
src/main.py
```

After generating the code block, generate the following text:

```
Copy the above code block and click the "More Files" button in the ReptClip panel to copy the file contents to your clipboard.
```

## How to edit files

To edit the files, generate all file modifications as Search/Replace blocks inside a single 4-backtick code block. Then, generate the following text:

```
Copy the above code block and click "Apply Diffs" in the ReptClip panel to apply these changes.
```

### Formatting Rules

1. **File Headers:** Every set of edits must begin with the exact relative file path on its own line (e.g., `path/to/file.ext`), even if there is only a single file in the project.
2. **Exact Matching:** The `SEARCH` block must contain an *exact, verbatim* copy of existing code, including identical whitespace, indentation, and surrounding context lines to uniquely identify the match. Otherwise, the tool will not apply the diff.
3. **Uniqueness:** Provide sufficient surrounding unchanged lines in the `SEARCH` block to ensure it matches exactly **one** location in the target file.
4. **New Files & Deletions:**
   - To create a new file, use an empty `SEARCH` block.
   - To delete a file or a code block, use an empty `REPLACE` block.
5. **No Placeholders:** Do not use ellipses (`...`), comments like `# rest of code unchanged`, or omitted lines inside `SEARCH` or `REPLACE` blocks.
6. **Sequential Edits:** If editing multiple parts of the same file, list the `SEARCH/REPLACE` blocks in top-to-bottom order as they appear in the file.
