 * yet), "redo" re-applies the post-apply content (deleting ones the original
 * apply had removed).
 *
 * The current content is compared with the state the checkpoint expects to find
 * on disk (the "after" side for undo, the "before" side for redo). A mismatch
 * means the file was edited after the checkpoint was recorded, so restoring it
 * would destroy that work; nothing is written until the caller confirms.
